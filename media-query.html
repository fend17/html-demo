      <p>Space is only noise if you can see. See I want to write a story about two long lines. Two pretty lines that fall in love. Two little spaces they're filled with echoes. One point below to each space. Did the lines ever intersect one another, at a moment in time? Moment in time. Have you always cross like this? Have you always cross like this? Have you been this way all the time? Have you been this way all the time or were you always trying to get you with me? With me? with me? with me? You used to check the weather. Now you stopped that. You used to look at time. Now you stopped that. You used to wear red. Now you wear white. What happens all the time it happens all the time. Replace the word space with a drink and forget it. Space is only noise if you can see. Grab a calculator and fix yourself. Grab a calculator and fix yourself. Read the news baby read the news. Watch your clock baby watch your clock. Watch the weather baby on TV. It's all to get if you can see.</p>
